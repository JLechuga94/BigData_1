### Attention Homework 3!!
Plots in the notebook are a bit heavy, so we decided to include the *HTML* files
for the notebook, choropleth slider plots and the heatmaps.
This files are in the **/homework03_html** folder.

This is because running and showing the choropleth plots with sliders requires
200Mb of memory and this will probably cause the notebook to crash. The *HTML*
files for the slider plots were compressed to avoid issues when uploading them to
Github since they weigh 100Mb.

In case the compressed files are corrupt or the plots do not show correctly, please
run the code for the choropleth sliders in order to create local *HTML* files.
*Several hours were invested into making these specific plots work so it would
be a shame not to be able to appreciate them :)*

Currently the *HTML* for the notebook (file **homework03_html/homework03.html**), does not
show the *Ipleaflet HeatMaps* for questions 4.3.A and 4.3.B. This is probably due to the type of
image used by Ipleaflet. In case the notebook (file **homework03_html/homework03.ipynb**) also does
not show the heatmaps please run the section of code for those specific questions
in order to show the plots. Nonetheless these files are also included in the
**/homework03_html** folder and they are also displayed below.
