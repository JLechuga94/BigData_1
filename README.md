For the DM3, since the plots in the notebook are a bit heavy, we decided to
include the HTML files for the whole notebook and individual files for the
slider graphs for the final question, this files are in the /homework03_html folder.

This is because running and showing the choropleth maps with sliders requires
200Mb of memory and this will probably cause the notebook to crash. The HTML
files for the slider plot were compressed to avoid issues with uploading them to
github since they weigh 100Mb.

Of course if the files are corrupt or the plots do not show correctly, please run
the code for the final questions in order to create a local HTML file for the
choropleth sliders. Several hours were invested into making this specific plots
work so it would be a shame not to be able to appreciate them.

The HTML for the notebook doesn't show the Ipleaflet HeatMaps for questions
4.3.A and 4.3.B, in case the uploaded notebook (file .ipynb) doesn't show them,
please run the section of code for those specific questions in order to show the
heatmap plots.
